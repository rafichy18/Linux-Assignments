# Linux Management
### Assignment 1
# Account Setup
In the first step, I have created a Microsoft Azsure account using our university email address. Then, my microsoft azsure account is successfully created and I have recevied $100 worth of credit which helps me to purchase different types of useful learning environment.

# Create Virtual Machine
I have created a virtual machine where I can learn and do some projects for this course.
Then, I named the machine "lab-robotics" and then I have select the no infrastructure redundancy required option and Trusted launch virtual machines security type.
I choosed Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS - x64 Gen2 server and B series version 2 which is Standard_B21s_v2.
After completing all the steps, I got a key and I have selected the connect option and choose the native ssh option.
There is a copy and execute SSH command button, I have pasted the key which I have got earlier.
Then open the windows powershell and paste the link generated link there and I reached in the Linux virtual machine.

## APT Package Management Assignment

## **Part 1: Understanding APT & System Updates**

### **1. Check APT Version**
```bash
apt --version
```
**Output:**  _(apt --version
apt 2.7.14 (amd64)

### **2. Update the Package List**
```bash
sudo apt update
```
**Explanation:** This command fetches the latest package lists from configured repositories, ensuring we get the latest versions and security updates.

### **3. Upgrade Installed Packages**
```bash
sudo apt upgrade -y
```
**Difference between `update` and `upgrade`:**  
- `update`: Refreshes the package list but doesnâ€™t install updates.
- `upgrade`: Installs the latest versions of all packages listed in the updated package list.

### **4. View Pending Updates**
```bash
apt list --upgradable
```
Pending Updates:  rafi@lab-robotics:~$ apt list --upgradable
Listing... Done
---
## **Part 2: Installing & Managing Packages**

### **1. Search for an Image Editor**
```bash
apt search image editor
```
**Selected Package:**  zim 
### **2. View Package Details**
```bash
apt show zim
```

**Output (Key Information)**

rafi@lab-robotics:~$ apt show zim

** Is the package fully removed?
- No, the configuration files are still on the system.
### ** 2. Remove Configuration Files
sudo apt purge zim -y

### Screenshot

# Difference between remove and purge:

- Remove: Deletes the package but keeps configuration files.
- Purge: Deletes both the package and its configuration files.

# 3. Clear Unnecessary Package Dependencies
sudo apt autoremove -y
# Why is this step important?

- It removes unneeded dependencies that were installed automatically.
- Frees up disk space.
### 4. Clean Up Downloaded Package Files
sudo apt clean
# What does this command do?

- It removes cached package files from /var/cache/apt/archives.
- Helps free up disk space.
### Part 4: Managing Repositories & Troubleshooting
*** 1. List All APT Repositories
cat /etc/apt/sources.list

### What do you notice in this file?

- It contains a list of repositories (deb or deb-src lines).
- Lists sources where packages are downloaded from.
# 2. Add the Universe Repository
sudo add-apt-repository universe
sudo apt update
# What types of packages are found in the universe repository?

- Community-maintained software, not officially supported by Ubuntu.
# 3. Simulate an Installation Failure and Troubleshoot
sudo apt install fakepackage
*** Output:
E: Unable to locate package fakepackage
# How would you troubleshoot this issue?

- Verify that the package name is correct.
- Run sudo apt update to refresh package lists.
- Check if the package is in the enabled repositories.
# Bonus Challenge (Optional)
# Hold a Package
sudo apt-mark hold zim
# Why would you want to hold a package?

- To prevent updates that might break compatibility.
### Unhold a Package
sudo apt-mark unhold zim

# Linux Virtualization Exercise

## Introduction

This report documents the steps taken to complete the Linux Virtualization exercise on an Ubuntu 24.04 system with nested virtualization enabled. It covers Multipass, LXD, Docker, and Snapcraft.

# Part 1: Virtualization Concepts

### Research on Virtualization Concepts

Virtualization enables running multiple operating systems or applications on the same physical machine using a hypervisor. There are two main types of virtualization:

Full Virtualization (VMs): Uses a hypervisor to emulate hardware and run multiple OS instances.

Container-Based Virtualization: Uses OS-level isolation to run multiple applications in isolated user spaces.

# Part 2: Working with Multipass

# Installing Multipass

```bash
sudo snap install multipass
```
### Basic Multipass Commands

### Launching a Default Ubuntu Instance
```bash
multipass launch --name test-vm
```
### Listing Instances
```bash
multipass list
```
### Accessing the Instance Shell
```bash
multipass shell test-vm
```
### Cloud-init Configuration

### Created a cloud-init.yaml file:
```bash
#cloud-config
package_update: true
packages:
  - nginx
  - htop
users:
  - name: student
    sudo: ['ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL']
```

### Launching a Multipass VM with Cloud-Init
```bash
multipass launch --name my-cloud-vm --cloud-init cloud-init.yaml
```
### Verifying Nginx Installation
```bash
multipass shell my-cloud-vm
systemctl status nginx
```

```bash
sudo snap install snapcraft --classic
```
# Packaging a Simple App into a Snap
### Created a snapcraft.yaml file:
```bash
name: my-snap
