Linux
Account Setup
In the first step, I have created a Microsoft Azsure account using our university email address. Then, my microsoft azsure account is successfully created and I have recevied $100 worth of credit which helps me to purchase different types of useful learning environment.

Create Virtual Machine
I have created a virtual machine where I can learn and do some projects for this course.
Then, I named the machine "lab-robotics" and then I have select the no infrastructure redundancy required option and Trusted launch virtual machines security type.
I choosed Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS - x64 Gen2 server and B series version 2 which is Standard_B21s_v2.
After completing all the steps, I got a key and I have selected the connect option and choose the native ssh option.
There is a copy and execute SSH command button, I have pasted the key which I have got earlier.
Then open the windows powershell and paste the link generated link there and I reached in the Linux virtual machine.
